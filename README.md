# To-Do List
This project is a web app that lets users create to-do lists and store them in the cloud 
or on their local device memory for later access. The cloud storage functionality is enabled
by implementing the Google Firebase API. Users can sign up for accounts on my app and 
authenticate themselves using email, Google accounts, Facebook Accounts, or their 
Github accounts.
