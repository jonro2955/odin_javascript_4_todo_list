# To-Do List
This is a web app that lets users create to-do lists and store them in the cloud using their Google, Facebook, or Github accounts. It uses the Google Firebase SDK to implement the backend database and authentication. Users have daily, weekly, monthly and yearly to-do lists as default routine lists, and they can also create "projects" which they can name and delete later. Each list item can be ticked off with a checkmark to indicate that they are done, which crosses the item label off on the screen. This project is organized into javascript classes to implement object oriented design, where each task, project and collection is an object instantiated with a constructor.
