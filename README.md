This is the 4th project form The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Curriculum.

It is a web app that lets users create "to do" lists and store them in the cloud.

It focuses on ES6 modules, ES6 classes, SOLID OOP design, and Google's Firebase API. 

It uses Google's Firebase APIs to achieve user authentication and data storage.

Webpack is used to import external NPM libraries such as date-fns and other internally created modules.

Eslint is used to format the code and check for errors.
